This living project is an example on how to get a React client, and a Node.js server to run.. This requires the running of both the client server and the api server "concurrently". Use the "dev" options to create a devoloper environment and the "production" option when ready to build the API code for production. The tools used in this project are React.js, Express.js, Babel-Register, Babel-CLI, Nodemon, Yarn and the Concurrently NPM package.

A few notes.. As of now, this project does not have an env or Procfile, hence, it is not suitable for deployment. Also, going forward, Babel's new "env" preset replaces the ES2015,ES2016 etc. presets. Learn more here https://babeljs.io/

What is React ?
React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

What is Express.js ?
Express is a light-weight web application framework to help organize your web application into an MVC architecture on the server side.

What is Babel ?
Babel is a JavaScript transpiler that converts edge JavaScript into plain old ES5 JavaScript that can run in any browser (even the old ones).

What is Nodemon ?
Nodemon is a utility that will monitor for any changes in your source and automatically restart your server.

What is Concurrently ?
Allows you to run multiple commands concurrently.

Available Root Commands:

* "npm run devServer" - runs API with Nodemon & Babel

* "npm run server" - runs API with Node & Babel

* "npm run clean" - removes the dist directory which is where compiled production code is stored

- "npm run build" - removes dist, then recreates dist and places compiled code

* "npm run dev" - runs API developement server & client server concurrently with nodemon & Babel

* "npm run production" - compiles code in dist directory, runs production API server & client server concurrently with node
